# The-complete-web-development-bootcamp-2023-course-projects-and-codes-snippets

In this project I have uploaded  the coding I have done along with the course instructor. The link to the course is - https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/ . I have only uploaded the course projects here and some other stuff which I thought was important.

In every folder the index file contains my code, and the goal png or file contains the goal for the code.

Be sure to check them up if you want to learn about HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstarp etc.
