<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I embarked on my coding journey nearly a year ago, immersing myself in the fundamentals of coding. 
  My expertise lies in Python, where I am adept at performing tasks ranging from basic loop execution to crafting object-oriented 
  programming models. I can proficiently create linked lists, navigate through them, and handle various other data structure-related 
  tasks. My current studies encompass time complexity and algorithms.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I possess knowledge in C#, capable of executing tasks associated with object-oriented programming. 
  My skill set extends to basic HTML, CSS, and SQL programming.</p>

<p>Problem-solving is both my hobby and a skill I actively cultivate. 
  I embrace coding challenges on platforms like Codeforces and enthusiastically tackle IT assignments from fellow students. 
  My current pursuits include delving into Full Stack web development and exploring diverse Python frameworks. Concurrently, 
  I am enhancing my proficiency in data structures and algorithms. - write me 5 skills based on this for my cv and add more 
  stuff if you think its important</p>
